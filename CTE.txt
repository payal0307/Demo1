1)calculate the total value of a user's portfolio, 
and you want to use a CTE to help with the calculation
WITH StockValues AS (
    SELECT
        p.userID,
        p.stockID,
        p.quantity,
        ph.closePrice AS stockPrice,
        p.quantity * ph.closePrice AS stockValue
    FROM Portfolio p
    JOIN PriceHistory ph ON p.stockID = ph.stockID
    WHERE p.userID = @UserID
)

-- Calculate the total portfolio value
SELECT
    userID,
    SUM(stockValue) AS TotalPortfolioValue
FROM StockValues
GROUP BY userID;
2) retrieve a list of users who have made the most number of transactions 
and display the total number of transactions for each user. 
You can use a CTE for filtering and aggregation:

WITH UserTransactionCounts AS (
    SELECT
        t.userID,
        COUNT(*) AS TransactionCount
    FROM Transactions t
    GROUP BY t.userID
)

-- Retrieve users with the most transactions
SELECT
    u.userName,
    utc.TransactionCount
FROM UserTransactionCounts utc
JOIN Users u ON utc.userID = u.userID
WHERE utc.TransactionCount = (SELECT MAX(TransactionCount) FROM UserTransactionCounts);
